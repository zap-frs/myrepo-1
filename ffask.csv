ABUDA, Respondent.","Parties who have validly executed a contract and have availed themselves of its benefits may not, to escape their contractual obligations, invoke irregularities in its execution to seek its invalidation.

This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 assailing the Court of Appeals' October 26, 2011 Decision and its March 8, 2012 Resolution. The Court of Appeals affirmed the Regional Trial Court's December 19, 2008 Decision upholding the validity of the mortgage contract executed by petitioner Florante Vitug (Vitug) and respondent Evangeline A. Abuda (Abuda).

On March 17, 1997, Abuda loaned P250,000.00 to Vitug and his wife, Narcisa Vitug.1 As security for the loan, Vitug mortgaged to Abuda his property in Tondo Foreshore along R-10, Block A-50-3, Del Pan to Kagitingan Streets, Tondo, Manila.2 The property was then subject of a conditional Contract to Sell between the National Housing Authority and Vitug.

1,"G.R. No. 178110, January 12, 2016 - AYALA LAND, INC. AND CAPITOL CITIFARMS, INC., Petitioners, v. SIMEONA CASTILLO, LORENZO PERLAS, JESSIELYN CASTILLO, LUIS MAESA, ROLANDO BATIQUIN, AND BUKLURAN MAGSASAKA NG TIBIG, AS REPRESENTED BY THEIR ATTORNEY-IN-FACT, SIMEONA CASTILLO, Respondents.","First, the doctrine of finality of judgment. The doctrine is grounded on the fundamental principle of public policy and sound practice that, at the risk of occasional error, the judgment of courts and the award of quasi-judicial agencies must become final on some definite date fixed by law.

On 29 August 1995, the Supreme Court in G.R. Nos. 85960 and 92610 allowed the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, as receiver, to sell the assets of the Manila Banking Corporation (MBC), including the subject property, to a third party.1 It may be recalled that the property was earlier mortgaged to the MBC by Capitol Citifarms, Inc. (CCFI), and was later awarded to the former in an auction sale. Pursuant to the Court's Resolution, a ""Deed of Absolute Sale""2 over the property was executed in favor of Ayala Land, Inc. (ALI) in December 1995.3

In a Resolution dated 27 July 1999, the Court considered G.R. Nos. 85960 and 92610 closed and terminated.4

On 13 August 2003, Case No. A-9999-04-CV-203-00 — or the Petition for Revocation filed by Lamberto Javier et al. — was also deemed closed as far as the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) was concerned.5 The Bureau of Agrarian Legal Assistance was also directed to issue a Certificate of Finality of the Order dated 26 September 2002 issued by former DAR Secretary Hernani Braganza reversing the revocation of the Conversion Order.

Second, the rule that he who alleges must prove. Rule 131, Section 1 of the Rules of Court, places the burden of proof on the alleging party to present evidence on the facts in issue necessary to establish the claim or defense.

It is simply not the role of the Court to apply the missing Notice of Acquisition in perpetuity. Even the Dissent concedes that the records are bereft of any trace of the Notice of Acquisition. This is not a case of a feudal landowner unjustly enriched by the hard work of a long-suffering tenant. ALI is in the precarious position of having been that third-party buyer that offered the terms and conditions most helpful to, ultimately, the BSP. Prior to that acquisition, there was absolutely no relationship between ALI and the farmers. Respondents, on the other hand, are residents who have not yet established any claim — let alone substantial rights — over the land. On the contrary, what has been duly established is that they have received disturbance compensation.6

Respondents never raised the issue regarding the existence or effect of a Notice of Acquisition. Their arguments revolved on the alleged illegality of the sale and the submission of a Sangguniang Bayan resolution, instead of an ordinance. Their brief was primarily on the form in which the local government's action was contained. We also note that they were specifically ordered by the Court of Appeals (CA) to submit a copy of the Notice of Acquisition, but they failed to comply.7

They made no attempt at all to explain their inability to present a copy of the Notice of Acquisition.

Third, the duty of the Court to correct reversible errors of law committed by the CA. It was a grave error on the part of the CA to base its ruling on a conclusion of fact that is not supported by the records of the case. It is settled that issues raised for the first time on appeal and not raised in the proceedings below ought not to be considered by a reviewing court. Points of law, theories, issues, and arguments not brought to the attention of the trial court are barred by estoppel. Especially, as in this case, when the document being cited is not in the record.

Fourth, the doctrine of primary jurisdiction. We reiterate what has been said in the Decision. That is, even assuming that the Notice of Acquisition did exist, considering that CCFI and ALI have had no chance to controvert the CA finding of its legal bar to conversion, this Court is unable to ascertain the details of the Notice of Acquisition at this belated stage, or rule on its legal effect on the Conversion Order duly issued by the DAR, without undermining the technical expertise of the DAR itself. This whole controversy was reviewed and the Conversion Order validated by no less than two DAR Secretaries.

The doctrine of primary jurisdiction holds that if a case is such that its determination would require the expertise, specialized training, and knowledge of an administrative body, relief must first be obtained in an administrative proceeding before resorting to the courts, even if the matter may well be within the latter's proper jurisdiction.

Fifth, the great weight and respect accorded to factual findings of administrative agencies. The factual findings of the DAR Secretary, who, by reason of his official position, has acquired expertise in specific matters within his jurisdiction, deserve full respect. Except for a justifiable reason, these findings ought not to be altered, modified or reversed.",January 12 2016,https://www.chanrobles.com/cralaw/2016januarydecisions.php?id=2

We point out that the concept of newly-discovered evidence is applicable only when a litigant seeks a new trial or the re-opening of the case in the trial court. Seldom is the concept appropriate on appeal, particularly one before the Court. The absence of a specific rule on the introduction of newly-discovered evidence at this late stage of the proceedings is not without reason. The Court would be compelled, despite its not being a trier of facts, to receive and consider the evidence for purposes of its appellate adjudication.",January 11 2016,https://www.chanrobles.com/cralaw/2016januarydecisions.php?id=5
